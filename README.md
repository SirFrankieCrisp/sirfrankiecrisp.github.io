# Study Questions evolutionary biology

## What are they main forces driving evolution?
## What is the Tornado in a scrapyard fallacy and does it not apply to evolution. Explain.
## Give two examples where evolution happens/happened really fast
## Why is evolution slower over long periods of time then over short periods of time?
## Give an example of stabilizing selection
## What other kinds of selection are there
## Most mutations are deleterious/negative selection. Why are we not all just dead or ill?
## What is over and underdominance? Give an example for overdominance.
## Which is the most important determinant of evolutionary change?
## Explain the dynamics of allele frequency under selection in haploids and diploid (both dominant and recessive) over time.
## What are morphogen gradients and how do they play a role in the development of organisms? Give two examples.

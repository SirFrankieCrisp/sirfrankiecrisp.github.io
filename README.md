# Study Questions Evolutionary Biology
## Chapter 1

### What are they main forces driving evolution?

### What for conditions need to be present for evolution through natural selection?

## Chapter 2.1

### What is the "Tornado in a junk yar" and how it does/ doesn't apply to evolution (Why is it a fallacy). Explain.

### Give two examples where evolution happens/happened really fast

### Why is evolution slower over long periods of time then over short periods of time?

### Give an example of stabilizing selection

### What other kinds of selection are there

## Chapter 2.2

### Most mutations are deleterious/negative selection. Why are we not all just dead or ill?

### What is over and underdominance? Give an example for overdominance.

### Which is the most important determinant of evolutionary change?

### Explain the dynamics of allele frequency under selection in haploids and diploid (both dominant and recessive) over time.

## Chapter 2.3

### What are morphogen gradients and how do they play a role in the development of organisms? Give two examples.

### What are "Boxes" in the context of evolutionary biology? Give a prominant example and explain how it works.

### Explain what Pax6 is and what researchers where able to do with that.

### What differentiates plants from other organisms interms of developmental control.

### Why is development preserved over life history (long periods of time) even though the organimsm themselves evolve?
